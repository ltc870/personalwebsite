# Welcome to Lawrence's Personal Website 

This project for Code Louisville will serve as the first iteration of my personal website. This readme file will detail the Code Louisville's requirements that were met within this project.

## Requirements

### Project Uploaded Using Git

This project was uploaded to GitHub using Git. This was good practice for me since I'm still learning how to use Git and Github. At first I was doing my work on my `main` branch, but after talking to my teacher and a newfound software engineer mentor, I created a second branch called `workbranch` and started doing my work on this branch. I ran into a little trouble using GitHub, where on my `workbranch` I was 1 commit ahead, 4 commits behind `main`, but thinking through what I needed to do, I solved the problem. This was a good experience for me, because I now I feel like I can solve the same issue quicker if it comes up again.

### Must use 3 custom CSS selectors

The 3 custom CSS selectors I used are:

  ```

  ### Use A Minimum of 2 Media Queries

  I used 2 media queries on this project, starting with a mobile-first approach. My media queries are:

  ```
  @media (min-width: 600px) 
  ```
  ```
  @media (min-width: 1000px)
  ```

### CSS Features Used

The CSS Features I used were:

* A `nav` menu that expanded or collapsed when moving from mobile to desktop or vice-versa.

* I used Flexbox in multiple areas of my project to change the layout of elements on my page.

* I used Grid in in multiple areas of my project to change the layout of elements on my page.

* I used a CSS Preprocessor for my project and utilized it's auto-prefixer tool so that my project can be viewed on multiple browsers. 

* There may be other features that were not on Code Louisville's list that I implemented such as giving my buttons and links hover and focus states.

---

### JavaScript Features Used

The JavaScript Features I used were:

* Used JavaScript to show and hide the `nav` window when pressing the hamburger menu in mobile and tablet screen width.

* Used JavaScript to hide the `nav` menu when one of the links were clicked in mobile and tablet mode.
